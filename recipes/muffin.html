        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This blueberry muffin recipe makes eight extra large and yummy 
            breakfast muffins with a sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually 
            double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top for a 
            wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin. Add extra 
            blueberries if you want!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>⅓ cup milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, cubed</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                Grease 8 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
            </li>
            <li>To make the muffins: 
                Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. 
                Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark; stir until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. 
                Fold in blueberries; set batter aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make the crumb topping: Combine sugar, flour, butter, 
                and cinnamon in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, 
                filling right to the top. Sprinkle with crumb topping.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the 
                center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
